**Bowtie2: A Fast and Sensitive Read Alignment Tool**
**Introduction**
Bowtie2 is a widely used open-source software tool designed for aligning sequencing reads to long reference genomes. It is optimized for speed and memory efficiency, making it ideal for high-throughput sequencing data such as those generated by Illumina platforms.

Key Features
- Fast and memory-efficient: Uses a Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) and FM-index for efficient alignment.
- Supports paired-end and single-end reads.
- Handles mismatches, indels, and gaps.
- Local and global alignment modes.
- Multithreading support for faster processing.
- Outputs in SAM format (compatible with SAMtools).
**Workflow**
  
Indexing the Reference Genome
Before aligning, Bowtie2 builds an index of the reference genome:
bowtie2-build reference.fasta reference_index
command to run bowtie2
bowtie2 -x GRCh38_noalt_as/GRCh38_noalt_as \
     -1 fastp_output/ERR14218891_trimmed_R1.fastq.gz \
     -2 fastp_output/ERR14218891_trimmed_R2.fastq.gz \
     --un-conc-gz bowtie2_output/ERR14218891_nonhuman.fastq.gz \
     -S /dev/null -p 16

| bowtie2                                               | The main program used for aligning sequencing reads to a reference genome.                                   |
| -x GRCh38_noalt_as/GRCh38_noalt_as                    | Path and basename of the Bowtie2 index files for the reference genome.                                       |
| -1 fastp_output/ERR14218891_trimmed_R1.fastq.gz       | Input file containing paired-end forward reads (R1) after QC and trimming.                                   |
| -2 fastp_output/ERR14218891_trimmed_R2.fastq.gz       | Input file containing paired-end reverse reads (R2) after QC and trimming.                                   |
| --un-conc-gz bowtie2_output/ERR14218891_nonhuman.fastq.gz | Writes pairs of reads that do not align to the reference genome into compressed FASTQ files.            |
| -S /dev/null                                           | Sends the alignment output (SAM file) to /dev/null (discarded).                                              |
| -p 16                                                  | Runs Bowtie2 using 16 CPU threads in parallel.                                                               |

**Summary**

This command aligns paired-end reads (R1 and R2) to the human reference genome (GRCh38_noalt_as). Instead of keeping the aligned reads, it discards them (-S /dev/null) and saves only the unaligned read pairs in compressed FASTQ format.
